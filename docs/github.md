# Survey of Projects on Github

[Searching for language with both sql and js](https://github.com/search?q=language%3A+sql+language%3Ajs)

Wow [adding topic of visualization](https://github.com/search?q=language%3Asql+topic%3Avisualization) yielded none --- part of that is sometimes people just don't label visualization, and part of it even when people are generating SQL, there is no lable (since I think it' just based on the extention of the file name).

Whereas [just JS and vis](https://github.com/search?q=language%3Ajs+topic%3Avisualization) gave 1K.

(sql with js and visualization)[https://github.com/search?q=sql+language%3Ajs+topic%3Avisualization] gave 5 results, again lossy, since Franchise didn't even show up.

I think the issue is that these are mostly libraries.


My hypothesis is that people do not publish it unless its a generalizable tool --- I suspect tha tthe market is probably people using Tableau/Looker, or private adhoc tools. Github has a bias for tool-based repos.

Maybe our better bet is looking at notebooks --- where people already write SQL(or pandas) queries and generate visualizations.


## Write SQL* and Chart the Results
\*by sql we include related, such as dataframes

These tools show up after searching [sql & visualization](https://github.com/search?q=sql+visualization).
