# DIEL IR

A relational transducer needs the following ingredients:

* input
* output
* state program

The rest is inside the execution (e.g., caching), which we will not include for now.

To represent the input, we have the input events schema, and their types — I guess the issue is that even for the same event, there might be different inputs. I suppose that’s something the developer should write themselves. — e..g, my diff dimension brushes — or they can write state programs such that they get merged into the same table, and the developer can deal with the table uniformly.

There is also the develoepr facing aspects, as well as the internal layer with SQL.

`diel` will be exposed as a class.

## parsing

Reference grammars:

* [SQLite](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/sqlite/SQLite.g4)

### input

syntax: `create input <name> (<column1> <type>, <column2> <type>)`

* generate JS, exposed via `diel.input`

To support distinct itxIds, the diel class keeps track of current itxId and will insert them inside the wrapper fuction for the inputs.

### output

syntax: `create output <name> as <query>`

* be bound with state update functions (we currently support logic for the likes of React) --- exposed via `diel.bind(diel.views.viewX, reactLifeCycleFunc)`.  `diel` will call `reactLifeCycleFunc` when there is a new interaction and pass it the input of `viewX` as specified.

### state program

syntax: `after input <input name> begin <insert program> end` (can only insert, and cannot insert into other inputs). The execution is in order and will be executed before the views are evaluted.

State programs are specified in terms of inputs --- it's essentially a trigger

* Need to place them into the right triggers and make sure that the bound output calls are evoked after

## Run Time

Most of the work should already be done
