once the query is compiled, we need to create corresponding UI pieces --- relations and columns will be colored

[ ] i wonder if we can implement hover over text, instead of turning text into UI whidgest beucase editing will be really clunky otherwise.

For the Joe demo, what we are going to do is the hover to see pop up of the visualizations (i will eventually look into vega)

And another where we "unclip" the where clause and see the data without the filter
